When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When working from more than one computer or when working with a team.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	For the same reason not to auto-commit; would want to have each version of the repository maintain logical integrity. 
	Time or automatic replication with a remote repository could have incomplete changes.
